# Module 1 

what is machine learning? 
    ML is the subfield of CS that gives "computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed" 

major ML techniques 
- regression/estimation 
    - predicting continous values 
- classification 
    - predicting the items class/category of a case 
- clustering 
    - finding the structure of data; summarization 
- associations 
    - associating frequent co-occuring items/events 
- anomaly detection 
    - discovering abnormal and unusual cases 
- sequence mining 
    - predicting next events; click-stream (Markov Model, HMM)
- dimension reduction 
    - reducing the size of data (PCA)
- recommendation systems 
    - recommending items 

difference between AI, ML and Deep Learning 
- AI 
    - tries to make computers intelligent in order to mimic the cognitive functions of humans 
    - general field with a broad scope including : computer vision, language processing, creativity, and summarization 
- ML 
    - branch of AI that covers the statistical part of AI 
    - teaches computers to solve problems by looking at hundreds or thousands of examples, learning from them, and then using that experience to solve the same problem in new situations 
- Deep Learning 
    - very special field of ML where computers can actually learn and make intelligent decisions on their own 
    - involves deeper level of automation in comparison with most ML algorithms 

supervised vs unsupervised 
- supervised : deals with labeled data 
    - classification : process of predicting discrete class labels or categories 
    - regression : process of predicting continuous values 
- unsupervised : deals with unlabeled data; fewer models and fewer evaluation methods that can ensure the outcome of the model is accurate --> creates a less controllable environment 
    - dimension reduction / feature selection 
        - reduce redundant features 
    - density estimation 
        - mostly used to explore the data to find some structure within in 
    - market basket analysis 
        - if you buy a certain group of items, you are more likely to buy another group of items 
    - clustering 
        - used for grouping and data points, or objects that are somehow similar 
        - used mostly for discovering structure, summariation, and anamoly detection
